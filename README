== The Wikidiscography Project

Q. Why another online discography?
A. All of the discographies I know of are simply lists of albums with a lot of information about each track,
e.g. personnel, instruments, titles, length. Wikidiscography aims to be the fist discography to be based on
sessions instead of albums. That means starting at the recording session itself instead of just listing album
information.

Q. Why start at the recording session?
A. Because it makes for more highly structured--and thus more easily searchable--data. Start with a recording
session, then associate the session with performances. Each performance is associated with a song and with
one or more performers. The session itself has a time and place, which data filters down to that session's
performances. Each performance can then be associated with a release (an album). In this way you can continue
adding information to sessions, performances, artists, songs, labels, and any other fields that are
important to discographical research.

Q. What will be the scope of this site?
A. The field of discography--and especially session-based discography--comes primarily from the jazz field,
and this site will cater to those interested in jazz research.

Q. What's wrong with the current discography sites?
Currently, the largest discography sites seem to be:
* discogs.com
* jazzdisco.org
* musicbrainz.org
Each of these is an album-based site, which limits possible search queries. With these sites, for example, one
could ask for ask for all the performances of "Four" that included Miles Davis and John Coltrane, but not all of
the performances of "Four" that DIDN'T include Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

Q. What's your vision for this site?
A. This will be a community-based site, with every user able to add and edit information.  I hope to seed it
with something significant, such as the complete Frank Sinatra discography or the complete Blue Note
records discography. Eventually I'd like to add an iTunes/Amazon link to each performance so that users can
immediately hear a track or purchase an album.

Q. Why are you doing this?
A. I am fascinated by programming and by the open-source community. I really enjoy learning abour programming.
I'm hoping to add something useful to the world, and I believe in the open source software model. If,
someday, somebody forks this project, improves it, and gives me a pull request, my life will be complete.

Q. Who are you?
A. My name's Andy. I'm a researcher at a Department of Energy laboratory in California (lbl.gov). Jazz
discography is something I happen to have some expertise in, because have an MA in Jazz History from Rutgers.
